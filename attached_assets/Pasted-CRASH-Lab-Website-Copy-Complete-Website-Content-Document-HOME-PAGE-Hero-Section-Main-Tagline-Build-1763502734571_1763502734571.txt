About CRASH Lab
Who We Are Section
Heading: Who We Are
Body Copy: CRASH Lab (Centre for Responsible Autonomous Systems in Healthcare) is an experimental research studio at the Koita Centre for Digital Health, Ashoka University. Modeled after MIT Media Lab and inspired by the Medical AI Bootcamp (Harvard-MIT-Stanford), we're building India's capacity to lead in responsible healthcare AI.
We are a virtual research studio that brings together leading minds from medicine, engineering, and data science to develop and rigorously test next-generation AI tools. Our focus is on ensuring these tools are safe, equitable, and ready for real-world deployment across India and beyond.

Why We Started Section
Heading: Why We Started
Body Copy: We started CRASH Lab to answer one fundamental question: What does it take to enable Indian physicians to conduct world-class collaborative AI research and compete globally while solving problems that matter for India?
The answer became clear. We needed a flexible research environment where busy clinicians could pioneer frameworks, prototypes, and practices that prioritize ethics, equity, and real-world impact. We needed to build infrastructure that doesn't exist yet. We needed to create standards when there were none.
The Challenge: Risks around bias, explainability, privacy, and equitable access demand that we invent, not just inherit, the way AI is developed and deployed in healthcare.
Our Response: CRASH Lab provides the space, resources, and collaborative ecosystem for Indian researchers to lead this invention process.

Our Approach Section
Heading: Our Approach
Radical Collaboration We bring together clinicians, engineers, designers, and social scientists. Medicine meets technology. Research meets practice. Theory meets deployment.
Open Science Infrastructure We believe in shared progress. Our data platforms, tools, and learnings are designed for collaboration. We're building national resources, not proprietary silos.
Real-World Validation Our AI solutions aren't tested in perfect conditions. They're deployed and evaluated in diverse, resource-limited healthcare settings where they need to work.
Bias & Fairness by Design Equity isn't an afterthought. It's fundamental. We audit, benchmark, and actively mitigate bias at every stage of development.
Empowering Frontline Clinicians Healthcare workers shape, validate, and use our AI solutions. They're not just end-users; they're co-creators.
